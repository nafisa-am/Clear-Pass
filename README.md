# Clear-Pass

# Application used HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Brief Description:

For this this project I was tasked with modifying a starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface.
